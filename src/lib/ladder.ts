// The summary ladder, model side. Two kinds of level, ONE call per node:
//   written  L0 topic ⊂ L1 takeaway ⊂ L2 brief. The model WRITES, seeing the
//            thread the node continues, what this step adds (the title chosen,
//            the number found, the option taken) and one sentence of reason.
//            Nesting holds by construction: the topic is located inside the
//            takeaway (else the takeaway's head), the brief is the takeaway
//            followed by the reason.
//   selected L3 abstract: 3 or 4 sentences of the answer, verbatim, in order,
//            the evidence behind the written lines.
// Two other designs were tried and read badly. A model writing four nested
// texts under a "delete only" rule paraphrases (0 of 8 held). Deleting words,
// then clauses, from the abstract kept every word from the answer but the short
// levels stopped meaning anything ("一个能一句话"). A written conclusion line was
// what the plaques had before 0.5.2 and what read best, so the short levels are
// written again, now with the thread in view, and the long level is quoted. The
// plaque morphs between them by longest common subsequence (ladder-core.ts).
// Everything that needs no model (tokens, pieces, levels, the local ladder)
// is in ladder-core.ts and re-exported here.
