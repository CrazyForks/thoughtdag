# Complete feature index

[中文](/zh/features) · [Guide map](/guides/)

This is a scan of current product areas. The feature guides explain how to use them; [Feature status](/reference/feature-status) separates current behavior from experimental directions.

## Canvas and navigation

- Multiple canvases with create, rename, switch, archive, and delete flows.
- Infinite canvas with middle/right-drag panning, wheel zoom, node movement, and box selection.
- Three semantic zoom levels: full cards, takeaway plaques, and icon-level markers.
- Minimap, zoom controls, frame navigator, node search, structural arrow-key navigation, and root-path highlighting.
- **Tidy layout**, local **Align**, frames, annotations, undo, and redo.

Guide: [Canvas, navigation, and frames](/guides/canvas-projects)

## Conversation nodes and floating panel

- One node stores a question, answer versions, model provenance, role, highlights, and attachments.
- Continue a path, **Explore** from selected text, edit questions and answers, or regenerate in place or as a sibling node.
- Floating panel for reading, version switching, attachments, highlights, merge order, grouped context tree, and follow-up input.
- Right-click node menu for panel/reading access, regeneration, summarizing to a note, copying, CLI continuation, duplication, archiving, and deletion.

## Wires and model-visible context

- Purple solid conversation paths, orange structural exploration branches, purple dashed summary references, and red dashed reviewer relationships.
- **Will send** preview grouped into materials, references, and conversation turns.
- Delete or convert a wire without deleting its nodes; archive content to exclude it while retaining it.
- Context fingerprints, stale markers, answer versions, and dependency-ordered replay.
- Controlled comparison by regenerating the same question and model after a context change.

## Material nodes and reader

- PDF, image, HTML, DOCX, Markdown, text, code, and link-snapshot materials within current [input boundaries](/reference/supported-inputs).
- Original/text/digest views where available; document recognition and editable extracted text.
- Ask from selected text or a selected visual region, save a passage or image as its own node, and preserve page provenance.
- Reading rail for source-grounded question chains, with jumps between source, answer, and canvas node.
- Material overview and inherited attachment controls.

Guide: [Material nodes and reader](/guides/materials)

## Organize and review

- **Merge summary**, **Merge & delete**, **Weave highlights**, structured highlights, and multiple downstream highlight modes.
- Condensed copy of consecutive unbranched runs while preserving the original path and protected decisions/pivots.
- Sliding reviewer nodes, graph diagnostics, and manual or automatic refresh of dependent work.

## Models, tools, roles, and memory

- Runtime provider presets, OpenRouter sign-in, Ollama, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, `.env` providers, and supported plan connections.
- Global model selection and node-level model pinning; model provenance stored per answer version.
- Web search, scholarly search, vision routing, and local/remote MCP tools.
- Inherited/set/reset node roles and editable role library.
- Memory as documents: a preferences and an identity document rewritten as facts arrive (with changelog and undo), one dossier per topic written from the labelled conversations (what it is, decisions, where it stands, still open; every line sourced), an inbox for project facts no topic claimed, and the other agents' memory files as read-only sources.
- Recall on an ask: the question's topics bring their dossiers in whole; a detail question adds verbatim excerpts ranked by relevance; every item listed with its cost, removable; three amounts (lean, standard, generous).
- Related conversations per node: the node's terms and topics as chips, model-proposed expansion, cards with open and cite.
- Decision model (fast thinking): one switch, on by default; a Jev-class System One endpoint through an aggregator, the official API, Cloudflare Workers AI, a self-hosted server, or the chat model as an uncalibrated stand-in; six-second timeout and a one-minute breaker, every decision falling back to a rule.
- Topics: a table the person names or the model proposes; labelling by the decision model in the host, in the background; `thoughtdag topics` on the command line.

## Session Atlas

- Discover supported local Codex, Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness, and Pi sessions by project folder.
- Read-only graph mirrors with conversation nodes and inspectable tool-result attachments.
- Incremental append, changed-session filters, multi-session canvas mounting, re-mirroring, and source-status indicators.
- **Sources** management and optional one-command handoff from supported agents.

## Toolbar, menus, and data

- Toolbar access to models, replay, frames, search, language, backup, overflow actions, undo, and redo.
- Overflow menu for annotation visibility, layout, highlight/material overviews, condense, diagnostics, sharing, exports, appearance, memory, and tutorial.
- IndexedDB persistence, automatic folder backup, complete JSON import/export, selected/context-chain Markdown, event CSV, and read-only URL sharing.
